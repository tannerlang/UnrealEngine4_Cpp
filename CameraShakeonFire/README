//Demonstrates how I created a camera shake effect in unreal engine, by creating a new class called camerashake1 inherited from the unreal engine MatineeCamera Shake class.

//Set my own shake values in the mycamerashake1.cpp files.

//Added a new subclass value of matineeshake called MyShake in the character.h file.

//Added the myshake value in the OnFire() function in the character.cpp file.
//in the editor, this lets me pick the mycamerashake1 class from the drop down menue when I search myshake in the details pane of the character actor in the engine.
