Overrode the tick function in the Character.h and Character.cpp files for my current world.

Created a line trace starting at the players gun, and using the player camera as a basis for the vector direction (forward)
set up FHitResults with collision and drawdebug events to print what the player is hitting with the line trace, and the point of impact position and normal position
used a drawdebugline every frame to see where the line is hitting in the editor.
