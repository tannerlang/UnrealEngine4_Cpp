Created a door and built gave it the ability to open and close.

Bound the opening and closing to the OnAction() function of the character.cpp/.h and used the toggledoor() function.

Used DotProduct with the character's forwardvector camera location to help determine what side of the door he is on,
which is then used when finding the max degree of the swing of the door, relative to the player's location.
