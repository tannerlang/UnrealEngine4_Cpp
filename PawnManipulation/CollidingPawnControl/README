I followed unreal documentation to create this.

created scene component hierarchy for a pawn. then built a new pawn movement component class (collidingmovement.cpp) to use for the pawns movement with the UE tick function
used pawn movement comp members in the new derived colldingpawnmovement.cpp file to give it the ability to interact with collisions surfaces and other environment physics stuff.
overrode the main colliding pawn tick function
overrode the main colliding pawn playerinput function

added and bound new inputs for the pawn
added a spring arm for the camera and attached the camera comp to it.
